"""
Application Management API Endpoints.

This module provides FastAPI endpoints for complete application lifecycle management in the authentication service.
Applications are the top-level entities that users register for and authenticate against.

The module supports:
- Application registration with name, slug, and description
- Retrieving application details by ID
- Updating application metadata and status
- Application deletion with verification

Features:
- Unique slug validation for application identification
- Application status management (active/inactive)
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Atomic database operations for data consistency

Security Features:
- Application slug verification for delete operations
- Input validation for all application data
- Database-level constraints enforcement
